# TODO
[x] turn into proper command line tool
[x] build and release artifacts with maven and git actions
[x] finish the tool since description is basically false advertisement :D
    - encode input text in a readable way after it has been compressed
    - decode compressed text to produce the original
[x] follow zozin, he mentioned something about grammars and grammars are cool!
