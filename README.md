# TODO

1. turn into proper command line tool

1. build and release artifacts with maven and git actions

1. finish the tool since description is basically false advertisement :D
    - encode input text in a readable way after it has been compressed
    - decode compressed text to produce the original

1. follow zozin, he mentioned something about grammars and grammars are cool!
